## Summary

Set up comprehensive memory and documentation system for Kris (OpenClaw agent).

## Tasks Completed

• **Created MEMORY.md** — Long-term curated memory with Spencer's preferences, projects, routines
• **Created TOOLS.md** — Environment-specific notes (GitHub, cron jobs, Telegram, security)
• **Created memory/ directory** — For daily notes (this file is the first)
• **Created diary/ directory** — For private Kris thoughts
• **Installed QMD skill** — Local hybrid search for markdown notes (BM25 + vectors)

## QMD Skill

• **Purpose:** Index and search local markdown files
• **Install:** `clawhub install qmd`
• **Requires:** Ollama at localhost:11434 for embeddings
• **Usage:**
  - `qmd collection add /path --name docs --mask "**/*.md"`
  - `qmd search "query"` (BM25)
  - `qmd vsearch "query"` (vector)
  - `qmd query "query"` (hybrid)

## Notes

• Backup script needs testing — verify it picks up new files
• QMD needs Ollama setup to function fully
• MEMORY.md should be reviewed and updated weekly during heartbeats

## Evening Updates

• **AGENTS.md updated** — Added orchestrator mode section with sub-agent spawning guidelines
• **MEMORY.md cleaned** — Removed technical details, kept personal context only
• **Added to MEMORY.md:** Gus (dog), skill sources (ClawHub, skills.sh)
• **Brave Search API** — Installed and tested (1 second response time)
• **Playwright** — Installed for browser automation
• **OpenCode** — Installed (opencode-ai), Z.ai auth needs manual TTY completion
• **Garbage cron updated** — Now uses Playwright with MDC site instead of web fetch
• **Morning briefing cron** — Confirmed scheduled for 6:30 AM CT weekdays
• **Trans Am research** — Tested Brave search with car facts
• **Coding agents reviewed** — Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi available via coding-agent skill

## System Status

• OpenClaw: v2026.2.15
• Security: Hardened (firewall, plugin allowlist, key-only SSH)
• Backups: Running every 2 hours to GitHub
• Cron jobs: 5 active (security audit, morning briefing, garbage checks, update check)
• Browser: Chrome headless with Playwright
• Search: Brave API + Kimi search available

## Late Evening

• **TTY/Tmux status** — Not working (socket issues), manual OpenCode auth needed
• **Garbage check confirmed** — Tuesday 8 AM CT, Wednesday 7 AM CT, alerts only on holidays
• **Proactive messaging** — Committed to updating user on progress, errors, completions
