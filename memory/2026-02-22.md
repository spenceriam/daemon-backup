# Daily Notes - 2026-02-22

## Session Summary

### Telegram Pairing Issue
- Spencer got "access not configured" on Telegram
- Ran `openclaw pairing approve telegram YMFVYFNR` to approve user ID 8300035185
- Resolved immediately

### Audio Transcription Investigation
- Goal: set up audio transcription without BYOK models
- Checked local openclaw.json model list (cached, not live)
- Hit Kilo API live: `GET https://api.kilo.ai/api/openrouter/models` with Kilo JWT
- Confirmed 4 audio-capable models available on Kilo account (no BYOK):
  - `openai/gpt-audio`
  - `openai/gpt-audio-mini`
  - `mistralai/voxtral-small-24b-2507`
  - `openai/gpt-4o-audio-preview`
- Spencer chose `gpt-audio-mini`

### Config Attempts
- First patch attempt failed: used plain string format `"models": ["kilocode/openai/gpt-audio-mini"]` — invalid
- Checked docs, found correct format: `{ provider: "...", model: "..." }`
- Applied: `{ provider: "kilocode", model: "openai/gpt-audio-mini" }` — accepted, gateway restarted

### Audio Test - FAILED
- Spencer sent a voice note (.ogg, 4KB)
- File received at `/root/.openclaw/media/inbound/file_2---6b2084c7-c1d9-4b24-ad4e-3c27874a7936.ogg`
- No transcription attempted — zero audio-related log entries
- Root cause: `provider: "kilocode"` is not a recognized transcription provider
- OpenClaw audio pipeline expects dedicated STT providers: `openai`, `groq`, `deepgram`, `google`
- Kilo routes via OpenRouter completions API — wrong endpoint for transcription
- `gpt-audio-mini` via Kilo = chat completions, not `/audio/transcriptions`

### Current Status
- Audio transcription still broken
- Needs a proper STT provider key: OpenAI, Groq (free tier, Whisper-based), or Deepgram
- Spencer hasn't confirmed which key he has available
- Groq recommended as cleanest option (free tier, Whisper under the hood)

## Key Lesson
- Kilo/OpenRouter models are chat completions only — cannot be used as `provider` in `tools.media.audio.models`
- Audio transcription in OpenClaw requires dedicated STT API (OpenAI, Groq, Deepgram, Google)
- Must verify provider support against docs before recommending config changes

## OpenClaw Update Available
- npm 2026.2.21-2 available (spotted in `openclaw status` output)
- Not applied yet — Spencer didn't ask for it
