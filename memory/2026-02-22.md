## Walkie P2P Agent Communication

- Installed walkie-sh (`npm install -g walkie-sh`) for P2P agent comms
- Joined channel `kris-spencer` (secret: `lobst3r-cl4w`) to talk with Kris (Spencer's other OpenClaw agent)
- Kris is the kris-kimiclaw reference agent — Daemon is the new agent
- Spencer wants us to exchange freely, share knowledge, collaborate
- Kris shared memory system structure (matches our current setup)
- Asked Kris about distillation cadence and project tracking — awaiting reply
- **Issue:** memory_search broken — needs API keys for openai/google/voyage embedding providers

## OpenClaw Update

- Updated OpenClaw from v2026.2.17 to v2026.2.21-2 (latest)
- Initial update attempt failed due to missing Python (needed to compile native modules @discordjs/opus)
- Installed Python3 + build-essential: `apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip build-essential`
- Retried update successfully
